# How many times have I been rejected from GitHub Education Program

Hey, I am Smajl, and I am a student...
And as we all know, github has a student program, sadly, my school doest't give out school IDs, and any other type of proof I sent to them was rejected at the apply proccess. I am here to make fun of my 100% rejection rate, of my GitHub Education Program Applications.

## What is this web for?

Here, I track all my applications, as well as the rejected ones. If there is or isn't a pending application and if I am alredy accepted or not!

## Is this web for fun, or cry for help?

The second option sounds right

## On what did you build?

This web is build on Svelte and Deployed on Vercel
